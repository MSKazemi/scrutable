# Product Questionbook

> Questions for the whole software lifecycle.

Product Questionbook is a reusable question system for designing, reviewing, and improving software products.

The goal is not to create a product with the most features. The goal is to make important decisions explicit, expose unknowns early, and build a product that is useful, usable, secure, reliable, operable, and sustainable.

## Start here

1. Read [the working method](docs/00-method.md).
2. Scan [the product aspects](docs/01-aspects.md) to decide what matters for this product.
3. Answer [the core questions](docs/02-core-questions.md) before major implementation begins.
4. Continue with the detailed question banks:
   - [Discovery and experience](docs/03-discovery-and-experience.md)
   - [Engineering, data, and integrations](docs/04-engineering-data-and-integrations.md)
   - [Trust, quality, and operations](docs/05-trust-quality-and-operations.md)
   - [Business, governance, and evolution](docs/06-business-governance-and-evolution.md)
   - [Naming and identity](docs/07-naming-and-identity.md)
5. Record the result using the [product brief](templates/product-brief.md), [decision record](templates/decision-record.md), [naming brief](templates/naming-brief.md), and [review scorecard](templates/review-scorecard.md).
6. If an LLM, agent, workflow engine, CI gate, API, or robot-connected system will consume the repository, read the [machine operation and output contract](docs/08-machine-operation-and-outputs.md).

## How it works

1. Establish the subject, lifecycle stage, desired outcome, constraints, and decision that the review must enable.
2. Classify each aspect as critical, important, relevant, or not applicable.
3. Ask only questions that can change a decision, expose a risk, or define verification.
4. Record answers with evidence, assumptions, unknowns, decisions, owners, and review triggers.
5. Propagate each important answer into requirements, decisions, risks, experiments, metrics, tests, approvals, or operational procedures.
6. Evaluate lifecycle gates. Critical safety, security, privacy, legal, reliability, or data-loss gaps block progress even when other areas score well.
7. Reopen affected questions when evidence, dependencies, users, scale, regulation, incidents, or strategy change.

## Outputs

A completed review produces a linked bundle rather than a single score:

- a product or system brief;
- a question and evidence ledger;
- decision records;
- requirements and acceptance criteria;
- risks, blockers, mitigations, and owners;
- experiments, research, and follow-up actions;
- integration and verification plans;
- success metrics, guardrails, operational controls, and support ownership;
- a gate result: proceed, proceed with conditions, pause, or stop;
- an audit trace and change-impact report.

See the [machine contract](docs/08-machine-operation-and-outputs.md) for the state machine, knowledge graph, structured Markdown format, output directory, integration boundaries, and completion rules.

## What a good answer contains

A useful answer is specific and testable. It should include:

- the decision or current belief;
- evidence and its source;
- assumptions and unknowns;
- trade-offs and rejected alternatives;
- an owner and review date;
- a way to verify the result.

Unknown is an acceptable answer. A vague statement presented as certainty is not.

## Suggested lifecycle

| Stage | Main outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Discover | A validated problem, audience, and desired outcome |
| Define | Scope, requirements, risks, and success measures |
| Design | Usable flows and sound technical decisions |
| Build | Tested, observable, secure, maintainable software |
| Release | Safe rollout, support readiness, and rollback capability |
| Operate | Reliable service, learning loops, and controlled change |
| Retire | Data export, migration, communication, and decommissioning |

## Machine status

Today this repository is a documentation-first decision framework. Humans and language-model agents can follow its Markdown, but it does not yet contain an executable parser, API, database, graph engine, or autonomous runtime.

The target machine will select applicable questions, maintain question state, link evidence and decisions in a graph, generate artifacts, evaluate gates, and reopen affected nodes when context changes. It reduces blind spots and makes uncertainty auditable; it cannot guarantee real-world success.

## Status

This is version 0.2: a broad documentation foundation plus a defined machine architecture contract. Future versions should add stable question IDs and metadata, schemas and validation, the graph and state engine, adapters, domain-specific question packs, examples, automation, and evidence-based scoring guidance.
